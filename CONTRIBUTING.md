Fix Bugs
Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug" and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Implement Features
Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement" and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it. Those that are tagged with "first-timers-only" is suitable for those getting started in open-source software.

### Write Documentation
SwarmOpt could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official docs, in docstrings, or with blog posts, articles, Youtube videos, etc. 

## Submit Feedback
The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/SioKCronin/SwarmOpt/issues

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome!
